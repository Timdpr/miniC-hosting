Hi everyone ! Thank you for your very positive feedback [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/aoskao/learn_c_and_its_lower_level_interactively_in_your/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/aosk8b/learn_c_and_its_lower_levels_interactively_in/) and [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19126544)!

I'm already working full-time and studying on weekends there isn't much time left for this project, just early mornings and late nights for now.

My goal free up at least one or two days per week and work more on this project, but that can only happen with your **[support](https://www.patreon.com/vasyop)**.
